A machine learning model to generate new Finnish surnames

When my husband and I were getting married, we wanted to choose a completely unique surname â€” one that no one else in Finland had.

Finnish name law requires that new family names must sound Finnish and be recognizable as names. To find a suitable surname, we decided to build a machine learning model to generate potential options that met these criteria.

For training, we used open-source data from the Digital and Population Data Services Agency and the Statistics Finland, which provided information on existing Finnish surnames and place names. The model was fed a string of names and then predicted the most probable sequences of characters based on the input data.

We quickly noticed that the quality of the generated names heavily depended on the input data. To refine our results, we experimented with different datasets, including Swedish surnames and Finnish place names (such as cities, towns, lakes, and other geographical locations, which often resemble Finnish surnames).

In the end, we were quite happy with our model and the names it generatedâ€”but we ultimately chose a surname from my motherâ€™s side! ðŸ˜Š

The model was coded in Python, and the project structure is as follows:

Folder data: Contains raw data from the data sources

Folder input_data: Filtered and prepared data for the models

Folder kotus-sanalista-v1: Finnish dictionary

Folder old: Discarded code from the project

Folder results: Model results

Files beginning with 00_: Code for preparing raw data
